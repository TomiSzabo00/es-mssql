# Exercise 1: Get the starter solution

1. Open the following URL to get your own repository: <https://classroom.github.com/a/e9QliRGi>

1. Wait for the repository creation to complete, then check out the repository.

   > If in university computer laboratories you are not asked for credentials to log in to GitHub when checking out the repository, the operation may fail. This is likely due to the machine using someone else's GitHub credentials. Delete these credentials first (see below), then retry the checkout.

1. Create a new branch for the solution and work on this branch.

1. Open the checked out folder, and type your Neptun code into the `neptun.txt` file. There should be a single line with the 6 characters of your Neptun code and nothing else in this file.

## Prepare and check the data

1. Download the data files from [here](BXBooks-CSV.zip) and extract the contents of this zip into the `data` folder.

   > Unfortunately we cannot include this in the starter repository due to limitations of GitHub Template Repositories. Hence the manual step here.

1. Open the CSV files to check their contents.

   > You will work with these datasets, hence familiarize yourself with their content.

## Next exercise

Read the submission guide below, then proceed with the exercises.

Next is [exercise 2](exercise2.md).

## When you are ready: submitting your solution

1. Verify that `neptun.txt` contains your Neptun code.
1. Verify in the git commit that you have modified and extended the starter solution and you followed the expected file naming conventions.
1. Verify that you have provided the required screenshots.
1. Commit and push your work. You can use the web frontend of GitHub to check the published contents inside your repository.
1. Open a pull request of your solution and assign it to user `akosdudas`.
1. If you are working in the university laboratories, delete your GitHub credentials.

### Remove GitHub credentials

In the university laboratories, the computer may remember your login information. To remove your credentials, follow these steps.

1. Open `Credential Manager` from the Start menu.
1. Look for GitHub tokens in the `Windows Credentials` page, and remove all of them.
