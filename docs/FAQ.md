# FAQ

If you face a problem, you may find a solution below.

### You cannot find your repository

Go to www.github.com, and after login, you will see the list of your repositories on the left.

### "Run failed" / "Checks have failed"

After each commit you push, a minimal set of tests are executed for verification. This email tells you that these checks have failed. You must fix these. In the email, you will find a link "View results." In the pull request, there is a "Details" link. You can check the logs of the execution here and look for red X-es marking the errors.

### You do not know that is the problem in your solution

It is not our goal with the evaluation to explain the problems precisely. It is part of your work to evaluate and test your solution. The error message can also come from the actual execution of your work and comes from the tools used.

### You finished your work but got no evaluation/grade

Did you: commit? Push? Open the pull request? Assign it?
