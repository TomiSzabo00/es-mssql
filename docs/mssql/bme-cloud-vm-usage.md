# Using BME Cloud

A prepared VM template with the name "BI laboratory MSSQL" is available in data centers of the BME cloud. Go to <https://niif.cloud.bme.hu> or <https://fured.cloud.bme.hu> and log in with your EduID. Find the template and use it to create a VM that has all the necessary software installed.

You will need an RDP client to connect to the cloud VM.

- Windows has the built-in _Remote Desktop Connection_ software,
- on a Mac, you can use [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466?mt=12),
- and on Linux [Remmina](https://remmina.org/how-to-install-remmina/) - or any other RDP-compatible software.

Please note that although being installed already, you may need to [login to Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/support/community-edition-expired-buy-license/) with a Microsoft account (e.g., your @edu.bme.hu account).

!!! note "VM performance"
    Please note that the performance of the VM depends on the usage of the cloud. You may experience a slowdown compared to a performant machine. The exercises can be solved on the VM in due time. You can help the VM by not running multiple Visual Studio instances simultaneously and not opening the browser inside the VM.
