# Exercise 1: Get the starter solution

!!! note "Submission guidelines"
    Do not forget to follow the [submission guidelines](../GitHub.md).

## Checking out your repository

1. Open the following URL and accept the assignment to get your own repository: <TBD>

1. Wait for the repository creation to complete, then check out the repository.

    !!! note ""
        If in university computer laboratories you are not asked for credentials to log in to GitHub when checking out the repository, the operation may fail. This is likely due to the machine using someone else's GitHub credentials. Delete these credentials first (see [here](../GitHub-credentials.md)), then retry the checkout.

1. Create a new branch for the solution and work on this branch.

1. Open the checked out folder, and type your Neptun code into the `neptun.txt` file. There should be a single line with the 6 characters of your Neptun code and nothing else in this file.

## Prepare and check the data

1. Download the data files from [here](BXBooks-CSV.zip) and extract the contents of this zip into the `data` folder.

    !!! note ""
        We cannot include this in the starter repository due to limitations of GitHub Template Repositories. Hence the manual step here.

1. Open the CSV files to check their contents. You will work with these datasets. Familiarize yourself with their structure and content.
