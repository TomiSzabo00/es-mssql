# Elasticsearch laboratory

This laboratory aims to practice working with _Elasticsearch_ through writing queries and aggregations and try out some visualization tools provided by _Kibana_.

## Pre-requisites

You need the following tools to complete this laboratory:

- Windows, Linux, or Mac: Every component you need is platform-independent.
- Elasticsearch and Kibana version **7.15.x**
    - Either run them using Docker, if you have Docker on your machine
    - Or you can download the binaries (see in Exercise 2)
        - You can also use a VM at <https://cloud.bme.hu>, see details [here](bme-cloud-vm-usage.md).

- A GitHub account and a git tool

## Material to review before the laboratory

- The expected mode of submitting your work, as detailed [here](../GitHub.md).
- The material covered in course _Business intelligence_ related to the topic, including, but not limited to
    - The demo material covered during the semester <https://github.com/peekler/Business-Intelligence-Demos/tree/master/ELK>

## Grading

Exercises 1 & 2 & 3 help you prepare the environment. Starting with exercise 4, **each exercise is worth one grade when completed successfully**. For an exercise to count as _successful_, you must finish _all_ its subtasks successfully. (E.g. if you complete exercises 4 and 5 successfully, but there is an error in exercise 6, and you did not complete exercise 7, the resulting grade will be 3.)
