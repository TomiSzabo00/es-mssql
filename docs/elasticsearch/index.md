# Elasticsearch laboratory

This laboratory aims to practice working with _Elasticsearch_ through writing queries and aggregations and try out some visualization tools provided by _Kibana_.

## Pre-requisites

You need the following tools to complete this laboratory:

- Windows, Linux, or Mac: Every component you need is platform-independent.
- Elasticsearch and Kibana version **7.15.x**
    - Either run them using Docker
        - Windows or Mac: [install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
        - Linux [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and [install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
    - Or you can download the binaries (see in Exercise 2)
- PowerShell
    - Included in Windows

    - [Install PowerShell Core on MacOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos)
- A GitHub account and a git tool

## Material to review before the laboratory

- The expected mode of submitting your work, as detailed [here](../GitHub.md).
- The material covered in course _Business intelligence_ related to the topic, including, but not limited to
    - The demo material covered during the semester <https://github.com/peekler/Business-Intelligence-Demos/tree/master/ELK>
- Elasticsearch documentation for reference
    - <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search.html>
    - <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html>

## Grading

Exercises 1 & 2 help you prepare the environment. Starting with exercise 3, **each exercise is worth one grade when completed successfully**. For an exercise to count as _successful_, you must finish _all_ its subtasks successfully. (E.g. if you complete exercises 3, 4, and 5 successfully, but there is an error in exercise 6, and you did not complete exercise 7, the resulting grade will be 3.)
