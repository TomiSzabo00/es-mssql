# Exercise 1: Get the starter solution

!!! note "Submission guidelines"
    Do not forget to follow the [submission guidelines](../GitHub.md).

## Check out the git repository

1. Open the following URL and accept the assignment to get your repository: <https://classroom.github.com/a/2JIfMQxz>

1. Wait for the repository creation to complete, then check out the repository.

    !!! note ""
        If in university computer laboratories you are not asked for credentials to log in to GitHub when checking out the repository, the operation may fail. This is likely due to the machine using someone else's GitHub credentials. Delete these credentials first (see [here](../GitHub-credentials.md)), then retry the checkout.

1. Create a new branch for the solution and work on this branch.

1. Open the checked out folder, and type your Neptun code into the `neptun.txt` file. There should be a single line with the 6 characters of your Neptun code and nothing else in this file.
