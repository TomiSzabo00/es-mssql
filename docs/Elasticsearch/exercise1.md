# Exercise 1: Get the starter solution

## Submission requirements

We are using GitHub for submitting the solutions:

1. You must complete your work in the **GitHub repository created through the link** (see below).

1. You need to **work on a new branch**, not on _master_. You may add any number of commits to the working branch.

1. Submit your solution for **evaluation by opening a pull request**.

   - Opening the pull request, and any subsequent commit, will trigger an **automatic evaluation** of your work. You will get the result as a comment in the PR.
   - There is limited capacity for executing these automatic evaluations. Therefore you are limited to **5 evaluations**. Further evaluations will be penalized. To stop automatic evaluation, close the PR, continue your work, push more commits, then open a new PR.

1. When you are satisfied with the results, **assign the PR** to your laboratory instructor (`akosdudas` on GitHub). This assignment is the final submission.

   - You must assign the pull request, because this is how we know, you are ready and do not wish to make any more changes. Do not assign the pull request until you are finished!

1. If you have a **question** regarding the automated evaluation, **use the pull request for communication**, and use `@akosdudas` mention in the comment text.

> **IMPORTANT** These requirements are mandatory. Submissions not following these steps are not evaluated.
>
> If GitHub and pull requests are unfamiliar to you, please read the [detailed guidelines](GitHub-usage.md).

## Checking out your repository

1. Open the following URL and accept the assignment to get your own repository: <TBD>

1. Wait for the repository creation to complete, then check out the repository.

   > If in university computer laboratories you are not asked for credentials to log in to GitHub when checking out the repository, the operation may fail. This is likely due to the machine using someone else's GitHub credentials. Delete these credentials first (see below), then retry the checkout.

1. Create a new branch for the solution and work on this branch.

1. Open the checked out folder, and type your Neptun code into the `neptun.txt` file. There should be a single line with the 6 characters of your Neptun code and nothing else in this file.

## Next exercise

Read the submission guide below, then proceed with the exercises.

Next is [exercise 2](exercise2.md).

## When you are ready: submitting your solution

1. Verify that `neptun.txt` contains your Neptun code.
1. Verify in the git commit that you have modified and extended the starter solution and you followed the expected file naming conventions.
1. Verify that you have provided the required screenshots.
1. Commit and push your work. You can use the web frontend of GitHub to check the published contents inside your repository.
1. Open a pull request of your solution and assign it to user `akosdudas`.
1. If you are working in the university laboratories, delete your GitHub credentials.

### Remove GitHub credentials

In the university laboratories, the computer may remember your login information. To remove your credentials, follow these steps.

1. Open `Credential Manager` from the Start menu.
1. Look for GitHub tokens in the `Windows Credentials` page, and remove all of them.
