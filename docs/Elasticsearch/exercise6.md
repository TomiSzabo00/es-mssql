# Exercise 6: _Elasticsearch_ queries â€” practice

The purpose of this exercise is to practice the search and aggregation capabilities of _Elasticsearch_. Feel free to take inspiration from the solutions in [exercise 4](exercise4.md). Please use the _Dev Tools_ of Kibana for creating and testing of the queries.

As in exercise 4, you are required to save the **query** JSON as part of the exercise. Please refer to exercise 4 for an explanation of what the _query JSON_ is.

- a) Who are the **3** youngest people?

  Save the _query JSON_ as `ex6-a.json`.

- b) Who are the **3** youngest people working at _KFC_ earning at least **80000** USD per year?

  Save the _query JSON_ as `ex6-b.json`.

- c) What is the average age of the workers at the different companies?

  Save the _query JSON_ as `ex6-c.json`.
