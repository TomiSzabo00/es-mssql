# Elasticsearch Business Intelligence

## Goal

The goal of this laboratory is to practice working with _Elasticsearch_ through writing queries and aggregations and try out some visualization tools provided by _Kibana_.

## Pre-requisites

You need the following tools to complete this laboratory:

- Windows, Linux, or Mac
  - Every component you need is platform independent.
- Elasticsearch and Kibana version **7.5.x**
  - Either run them using Docker
    - Windows or Mac: [install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
    - Linux [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and [install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  - Or you can download the binaries (see in Exercise 2)
- PowerShell
  - Included in Windows
  - [Install PowerShell Core on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux)
  - [Install PowerShell Core on MacOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos)
- A GitHub account and a git tool

## Material to review before the laboratory

- The expected mode of submitting your work, as detailed [here](GitHub-usage.md).
- The material covered in course _Business intelligence_ related to the topic, including, but not limited to
  - The demo material covered during the semester <https://github.com/peekler/Business-Intelligence-Demos/tree/master/ELK>
- Elasticsearch documentation
  - <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search.html>
  - <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html>

## Submitting your solution

To complete this laboratory you are required to solve exercises and submit your work through GitHub. The detailed description of the process of submission is detailed [here](GitHub-usage.md). Deadline: you must complete and submit your solution no later than **TBD**.

While completing your exercises, please include the scripts, packages, projects, etc. in your submission. A starter submission is provided to you. Fill in the missing pieces there.

> The exercises all highlight the `path` where you should put your solution. **Please follow these guidelines.** The submissions are checked automatically, and files and folders not adhering to the prescribed structure or content are not graded.

## Grading

Exercises 1 & 2 help you prepare the environment. Starting with exercise 3, **each exercise is worth one grade when completed successfully**. In order for an exercise to count as _successful_ you must finish _all_ its subtasks successfully. (E.g. if you complete exercises 3, 4 and 5 successfully, but there is an error in exercise 6, and you did not complete exercise 7, the resulting grade will be 3.)

**You will receive an automatic feedback in GitHub when submitting your solution.** This feedback includes a "total", which is the number of successfully completed exercises; this is a preliminary grade, and it is subject to change by the instructor.

**Your solution is expected to work in this automated evaluation environment**. Please take extra care following the exercise guidelines. The automated feedback will let you know if there is some error in your submission; you are required to fix these. The evaluation uses _GitHub Actions_. You have access to all the logs and the detailed result of every evaluation on the GitHub web interface. [This guide](GitHub-Actions-usage.md) helps you understand where to look for them.
