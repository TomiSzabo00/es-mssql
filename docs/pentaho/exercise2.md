# Exercise 2: Preparing the environment

The purpose of this exercise is to download _Pentaho_. Download and extract them on your machine or cloud. Otherwise, it is easier to go with the first one - also use this in the university computer labs.

## Get Pentaho Data Integration and Pentaho Report Designer 

1. Get Pentaho Data Integration and Pentaho Report Designer by downloading and extracting them.

    - When working at home: download the **8.3.x** version of [Pentaho Data Integration](https://privatefilesbucket-community-edition.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8.3.0.0-371/ce/client-tools/pdi-ce-8.3.0.0-371.zip) and [Pentaho Report Designer](https://privatefilesbucket-community-edition.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8.3.0.0-371/ce/client-tools/prd-ce-8.3.0.0-371.zip). Please make sure to use **version 8.3.x**; the starter code and the instructions might be specific to this version. Then extract the archives.

        !!! note ""
            Extracting the zip files will take some time. Some paths might be long, so it is best to extract these to a directory with a short path.

    - When working in university computer laboratories: locate the folders containing Pentaho in directory `c:\tools\Pentaho`. 

1. Start both using the executables `data-integration/Spoon(.bat)` and `report-designer/report-designer(.bat)`. There is no configuration needed.

1. Wait until they start.

    !!! note ""
        Startup might take up to a minute, don't be alarmed.

1. Close the Pentaho Report Designer for now.
