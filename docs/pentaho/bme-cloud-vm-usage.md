# Using BME Cloud

Windows and Linux VM templates are available in data centers of the BME cloud. Go to <https://cloud.bme.hu> (preferably <https://niif.cloud.bme.hu> or <https://fured.cloud.bme.hu>) and log in with your EduID. Find a template with enough space and use it to create a VM.

!!! note ""
    For example Windows 10 22H2 (20230901)  

You will need an RDP client to connect to the cloud VM.

- Windows has the built-in _Remote Desktop Connection_ software,
- on a Mac, you can use [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466?mt=12),
- and on Linux [Remmina](https://remmina.org/how-to-install-remmina/) - or any other RDP-compatible software.

!!! note "VM performance"
    Please note that the performance of the VM depends on the usage of the cloud. You may experience a slowdown compared to a performant machine. The exercises can be solved on the VM in due time. You can help the VM by not opening the browser inside the VM.
