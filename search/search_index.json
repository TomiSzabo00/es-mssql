Each laboratory is submitted in a GitHub repository that you will create through a provided link. The solution of the laboratory exercises are created within these repositories, then committed and pushed to GitHub. The submission is finished with a pull request assigned to the laboratory instructor. IMPORTANT The submission requirements detailed below and mandatory. Submissions not following these guidelines are not graded. Short version, aka. TL;DR \u00b6 The detailed description below shows the entire procedure. This short summary is an overview of the whole process. The lab exercises are solved in a dedicated GitHub repository created through a link in the exercise description. Your solution is submitted on a new branch, not on master. You can create any number of committed on this branch. You need to push these commits to GitHub. You submit your final solution through a pull request assigned to the laboratory instructor. You can ask questions regarding the results and evaluation in the pull request comment thread. To notify your lab instructor use the @name annotation in the comment text. Starting your work: git checkout \u00b6 Register a GitHub account, if you don't have one yet. Open the link in the exercise description to create your repository. If needed, authorize the GitHub Classroom application to use your account data. You will see a page where you can \"Accept the ... assignment\". Click the button. Wait for the repository creation to finish. You will get the repository URL here. Note The repository will be private. No one but you and the instructor will see it. Open the repository webpage by following the link. You will need this URL, so remember it. Clone the repository. You will need the repository git URL, which you can get from the repository webpage following the Clone or download button. You may use any git client. If you do not have a favorit yet, the simplest one is GitHub Desktop . You can list your repositories in this application directly from GitHub. If you are using console, the following command performs the clone (if the git command is available): git clone <repository link> If the cloning is successful, DO NOT START WORKING YET! The solution should not be committed to the repository master branch. Instead, create a new branch with the name solution . In GitHub Desktop, use the Branch menu for creating a new one. If using console, use the following command: git checkout -b solution Complete the exercises on this branch. You may have any number of commits and pushes. In university labs Before you make your first commit check whether your name and email address is properly configured. You can check this using the following commands. git config user.name git config user.email If the values are not correct, set your name and email address with the following commands executed in the repository directory.This will set the values for the repository. (It is recommended to set the email address to the one you use with GitHub.) git config user.name \"John Doe\" git config user.email \"john@doe.org\" At home WHen working from at home you may want to set the name and email address globally using the --global switch in the commands above. To commit using GitHub Desktop, first check if you are on the right branch. During the first push, the solution branch needs to be published. When adding further commits, verify the branch. You can publish the commit using the Push origin button. The little number of this buttons shows you how many commits need pushing. If you are using console, use the following commands: # Check the current branch and the files modified git status # Prepares all changes for commit git add . # Commit git commit -m \"f1\" # Push the new branch (first time) git push --set-upstream origin solution # Push futher commits git push Submitting the solution \u00b6 When you are ready with the exercises, verify on the repository web page that you uploaded everything. You may need to switch branches. GitHub web file upload We recommend that you do not use GitHub web file upload. If something is missing, add it to your local repository and commit and push again. When you are truly ready, open a pull request . Why the pull request? This pull request combines all changes you made, and shows us the final result. This helps the laboratory instructor to evaluate your submission more easily. This pull request means you submit your solution, hence this step cannot be omitted . To open the pull request you need to go to the repository's GitHub web frontend. If you pushed recently, GitHub will offer you to create the pull request.. You may also open the pull request from the menu at the top. It is important to specify the correct branches: master is the target into witch solution is merged. When the pull request is created, you will see a little number \"1\" on the Pull request menu showing you that there is one open item there. YOU ARE NOT FINISHED YET! The pull request will trigger a preliminary evaluation. You will see the result in a comment in the pull request thread. This evaluation may differ from the image. And it may take some time. If you need more information about the evaluation and the results, GitHub Actions can provide you more. See the short guide here . If you are not satisfied with your work, you can make further changes. You only need to commit and push your changes continuing to work on the correct branch. Any changes pushed will re-trigger the evaluation of the pull request . We ask that you trigger NO MORE THAN 5 evaluations ! Making further changes If you want to make changes to your submission and not have the re-evaluation run, you should close the pull request . When you are finished, you can open a new one instead. Maximum 5 Evaluations that fail due to transient errors, such as network problems, are not counted into the 5 evaluations. But if you trigger more evaluation by mistake, or on purpose, it will be sancioned. You are required to test your solution locally before submitting it. FINALLY , when you are ready, assign the pull request to your laboratory instructor. This step is considered as the submission of your work. Without pull request If you have no pull request, or it is not assigned to the instructor, we consider it work in progress and not submitted. Done Now you are ready. After assigning the pull request, make no further changes . The instructor will evaluate the submission and close the pull request. Questions and complaints regarding the final result \u00b6 If you have questions on concerns regarding the automated evaluation, use the pull request for communication with the instructor by asking questions via comments. To let the instructor know you have questions, please use @akosdudas mention in the PR comment. This will automatically send an email notification.

You have to options for running them: Using Docker Or installing them on your machine. In university computer laboratories use the Docker option. Otherwise chose the option best suited for you. Option 1: Start Elasticsearch and Kibana using Docker \u00b6 If you have Docker, or you are working in the university computer laboratories, use this option. Start Docker Desktop and wait for it to initialize. Only in university computer laboratories : open Docker Desktop settings (right click on the Docker icon on the taskbar), and follow the instructions from the laboratory instructor to configure a proxy to be used by Docker. Open a command prompt or PowerShell console and test whether Docker is working: execute docker version , which should print version information for client and server. Locate the provided docker-compose.yml file in the checked out starter solution (located in the root of your git repository). Open it in a text editor of your choice and check its contents. Check the following specifics: environment : This is used to set environment variables in the container. We can use these to provide some settings for Elasticsearch and Kibana as well. One example is the cluster.name variable. ulimits : In order for Elasticsearch to function properly, we have to set some ulimit values in the container. volumes : Due to how file storage works in Docker containers, every data is lost if we remove a container and start a new one. Of course, this is not exactly appropriate for a database service like Elasticsearch . Therefore we are going to use a volume which provides a more durable storage option. Navigate a command prompt / PowerShell / bash shell into the folder with the docker-compose.yml file, and issue the following commands. If you are in the university computer laboratories, please run docker-compose down -v first to remove any lingering containers and data left behind. Then to start, use docker-compose up . If you are using Linux, and this command fails, you might try to sudo to make things easier. Keep this shell open. You will see the application logs here. To shut down the running system, use CTRL + C . Your data will be kept, and restarting with the same command as above will restart the applications. To completely shut down the applications and remove all data, use docker-compose down -v . Option 2: Start Elasticsearch and Kibana by installing them \u00b6 Download Elasticsearch and Kibana . Please make sure to use version 7.5.x ; the starter code and the instructions might be specific to this version. Extract the archives. Extracting the zip files will take a considerable amount of time. Start both using the executables bin/elasticsearch(.bat) and bin/kibana(.bat) . There is no configuration needed; the default setup will work fine Wait for a few seconds while they start up. Elasticsearch will print something like this: [INFO ][o.e.h.AbstractHttpServerTransport] [xx] publish_address {127.0.0.1:9200}, bound_addresses {127.0.0.1:9200}, {[::1]:9200} [INFO ][o.e.n.Node ] [xx] started Note the port where Elasticsearch is available (should be 9200). Kibana, when ready, will print: [info][server][Kibana][http] http server running at http://localhost:5601 If you need to change the ports, edit the following files, then restart the applications: config\\elasticsearch.yml , look for key http.port , uncomment it and set a port; config\\kibana.yml , look for key elasticsearch.hosts , uncomment it and set the same port. Check that the systems are running \u00b6 Open a browser of your choice and navigate to http://localhost:9200 to verify that Elasticsearch is up and running. Make sure to verify the version too! Open a browser of your choice ( Kibana used to prefer Chrome , but you are free to experiment with others) and navigate to http://localhost:5601 . You should see Kibana's starting page.","title":"Exercise 2: Initializing Elasticsearch and Kibana"},{"location":"elasticsearch/exercise2/#exercise-2-initializing-elasticsearch-and-kibana","text":"The purpose of this exercise is to start Elasticsearch and Kibana .

Index a document via PowerShell \u00b6 First, we are going to use Elasticsearch's REST API through PowerShell . To index a document in Elasticsearch issue the following command. ( Invoke-WebRequest 'http://localhost:9200/test/_doc/1?pretty' -Method Put -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"name\": \"John Doe\" }' -UseBasicParsing ). Content This way we inserted a document of type _doc into the index called test with id 1 . The response JSON should state \"result\": \"created\" . Query the document with the following command. ( Invoke-WebRequest 'http://localhost:9200/test/_doc/1?pretty' -Method Get -UseBasicParsing ). Content The result JSON tells us the name of the index, the id of the document, as well as the full document we inserted in the _source field. { \"_index\" : \"test\" , \"_type\" : \"_doc\" , \"_id\" : \"1\" , \"_version\" : 1 , \"_seq_no\" : 0 , \"_primary_term\" : 1 , \"found\" : true , \"_source\" : { \"name\" : \"John Doe\" } } Create an index and index a document using Kibana \u00b6 In this part of the exercise we are going to create an index for documents containing information about people working in the fast food industry. Here is a sample document. Sample document \u00b6 { \"gender\" : \"female\" , \"firstName\" : \"Evelyn\" , \"lastName\" : \"Petersen\" , \"age\" : 17 , \"phone\" : \"+1 (900) 503-3892\" , \"address\" : { \"zipCode\" : 63775 , \"state\" : \"NY\" , \"city\" : \"Lynn\" , \"street\" : \"Clarkson Avenue\" , \"houseNumber\" : 503 }, \"salary\" : 87217 , \"company\" : \"Subway\" , \"email\" : \"evelyn.petersen@subway.com\" , \"hired\" : \"09/29/2009\" } We are going to use Kibana's Dev Tools for this part of the exercise. Although it uses the same REST API that we used through PowerShell , it provides a more convenient GUI for us to use. In this Dev tool we can run queries. A query contains of (1) a http verb and an URL matching Elasticsearch' REST API, and then (2) a body as JSON. In Kibana's Dev Tools enter PUT salaries in the first line and then enter the following JSON starting on a new line. Then press the Play button in the top right corner of the editor. { \"settings\" : { \"number_of_shards\" : 1 , \"number_of_replicas\" : 0 }, \"mappings\" : { \"properties\" : { \"gender\" : { \"type\" : \"keyword\" }, \"address.state\" : { \"type\" : \"keyword\" }, \"company\" : { \"type\" : \"keyword\" }, \"hired\" : { \"type\" : \"date\" , \"format\" : \"MM/dd/yyyy\" } } } } The settings we use here are the following. settings : We set the number of shards and replicas here. While settings the number of shards is not that important here, we must set the number of replicas to zero in order to have an index with green health value. This is because Elasticsearch refuses to put a shard and its replica on the same node, and we only have a single node. mapping : Mapping is the \"schema\" of the data. It is not necessary to set this, but when the data is ambiguous, Elasticsearch will make a choice how to interpret data, unless we specify the mapping. gender , address.state , company : These are values we know are only going to have a few select values (e.g. \"male\" and \"female\" for gender), therefore we do not want to allow free text search on them. We can help the system by specifying this. hired : Although this is a date field, the date representation of our data is not standard \u2014 Elasticsearch wouldn't recognize it by itself. Therefore we have to explicitly specify the date format. We can check the indices with the GET _cat/indices?v query. Note how the health of the test index is yellow and the health of the salaries index is green . That is because the default value for the number of replicas is 1 . Insert the sample document into the created index. You can find the sample document here . POST salaries/_doc { ... // the sample document comes here } Executing the query will yield a similar result (in the right side of the window). This is the response of the POST query with the id of the document inserted. We can use the _id value in the response to query the document. GET salaries/_doc/eZSmaGkBig5GeeBFsFG6 Modify the input data \u00b6 Before we import the rest of the sample data, let us make some changes by adding your Neptun code as a prefix to some of the values: Each gender value shall be prefixed, e.g. \"gender\":\"NEPTUN female\" Each company value shall be prefixed, e.g. \"company\":\"NEPTUN McDonalds\" Find the salaries.json file in the root of the repository. Open a PowerShell console here. Edit the following command by adding your Neptun code, then execute it in PowerShell (do NOT change the quotation marks, only edit the 6 characters of the Neptun code!): ( Get-Content .\\ salaries . json ) -replace '\"gender\":\"' , '\"gender\":\"NEPTUN ' -replace '\"company\":\"' , '\"company\":\"NEPTUN ' | Set-Content .\\ salaries . json Verify the results, it should look similar (with your own Neptun code): The file must be a valid JSON! Please double check the quotations marks around the values. If the result is not correct, you can revert the change made to this file using git ( git checkout HEAD -- salaries.json ), and then retry. The modified file shall be uploaded as part of the submission. IMPORTANT Adding your Neptun code is a mandatory step. It will be displayed on visualizations created in the following exercises. Index many documents using the bulk API \u00b6 And now let us index these documents. We can add multiple documents to the index using the bulk API. Issue the following command from the PowerShell window in the folder of the starter solution. Invoke-WebRequest 'http://localhost:9200/_bulk' -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -InFile .\\ salaries . json -UseBasicParsing Verify the response whether there are any errors. You will see a similar message if everything is OK (note the errors in the response): If you see a similar error, it means the changes in the source file resulted in an invalid json file. If this happens, you need to start over: Delete the salaries index by executing a DELETE salaries request in Kibana. Go back to the index creation step, then repeat the index creation and indexing of the single document. Reset the changes made to the salaries.json file, and retry the replacement with special care regarding the quotation marks. Now retry the bulk index request. Execute a search using query GET salaries/_search (using Kibana). This will return a few documents, and also let us know how many documents there are (total number matching the query will be the total number of documents, due to the lack of filtering in this search). There should be 1101 documents. If you see fewer documents, you need to use the Refresh API to make sure Elasticsearch is finished with all indexing operations.

SQL Server Management Studio \u00b6 If you need to create a new database, or create the tables, use SQL Server Management Studio . You need to connect to a Database engine , and use the server name and authentication method detailed in the course material. After successful connection, the databases are listed in the Object Explorer . Right click the Databases folder to create a new database. To run a new query click the New query button, write the query, and click Execute . Typical issues \u00b6 I just created a new database/table, but it does not appear in SSMS Refresh the list by right clicking the Databases or Tables folder in the Object explorer . Microsoft SQL Server Data Tools integrated into Visual Studio \u00b6 After installing Microsoft SQL Server Data Tools, you will find new project types in Visual Studio in the New Project wizard. The projects themselves contain mostly xml-based descriptions. For production use, these so-called packages are published to servers for execution. For debugging purposes Visual Studio is also able to execute the packages. Integration Services project \u00b6 The Integration services project contains a Package.dtsx (visible in Solution Explorer), which, when opened, presents a designer UI. There are two views to this UI: the Control Flow and the Data Flow . Control flow is the high-level component responsible for the execution of the entire process; Data flow contains part of the whole process, a single ETL flow. We build ETL processes by combining the two. The ETL process is built from the available components by dragging them from the SSIS toolbox and connecting them to each other. The SSIS toolbox can be opened from the View menu under Other Windows . The settings of each component can edited in the Properties box on the right, or by double clicking the boxes themselves. Notable components (from the SSIS Toolbox ) that you will need: Data Flow Task: data extract-transform-load sequence of steps Execute SQL Task: execute a command ADO NET/ Excel / ODBC/ Flat File / etc. Source/Destination: load or save data to/from Derive Column: transform a value or calculate a new value from existing data Conditional Split: split the data into two paths based on a condition Sort: sorting and duplicate filtering We can debug the process using the Debug button in the toolbar. During the execution we will get immediate feedback on the progress and the result. The detailed log can be viewed by clicking the Progress button, or in the Output window . If there are errors during execution, you will see the component that has issues marked with a red circle. In most cases the actual error you can find in the Output window. Typical issues \u00b6 The integration services project failed to execute Check the log in the Progress view, and locate the first error. You changed the properties of a connection manager and \"nothing works\" You need to open the data input or output component by double clicking it. It will update the changes made to the connection manager. CSV import fails if you removed columns in the flat file source connection manager Do not remove columns in the file source. You will just ignore the unnecessary columns later on. \"Truncation\" related errors You specified incorrect length in the flat file source connection details. \"... failed validation and returned validation status VS_NEEDSNEWMETADATA\", \"... has been out of synchronization with the database column\" , or similar errors Most likely you changed a column length either in the flat file source or in the database and the ETL process definition is not aware of this change. You need to find the component with this error (the name is in the error message), then right click it and open the Advanced editor and click Refresh . If doing this for a single component does not solve the problem, repeat the same action for all components, starting with the input source and following the data flow direction (this synchronizes the input of each component with the output of the previous one, hence the need to do this in order). When running the IS process in Visual studio it complains about \"file being used\" Close Visual Studio. Start the Task Manager, and kill the \"IS Debug Host\" processes. Re-open the solution in Visual Studio and try again. Reporting Services project \u00b6 The easiest was to start with a new project is to use the Reporting Server Project Wizard . It guides you through creating the project and then a new report. The report is presented in a WYSIWYG manner in a designer surface. You can add new elements from the Toolbox (open the toolbox from View menu under Other Windows ). The layout and contents is edited here, while the Properties of each element is specified in the toolbox on the right. You can also Preview the report here. Every report has a Data source , which is the connection to the database. You need to create this manually, or if you used the wizard to create the project, it may already exist. A Data set specifies the query that will fetch the data the report displays. Typically you create one data set for each component (table, diagram, etc.) you add to the report. The result of this query can be bound to fields of the report, e.g. display it in one column of the table. You can find these in the Report Data window (open it from the View menu). A report project can contain multiple reports. You can add new ones using the Solution Explorer.

You can find this solution in the root of the checked out git repository. Open the solution with Visual Studio, then open Package.dtsx from Solution explorer . Find the SSIS Toolbox ; you will need to use this window in the following tasks. If you cannot see this toolbox window, after opening Package.dtsx , look for the Extensions > SSIS > SSIS Toolbox menu. Add a new SQL Task to the Control flow that erases any content from the target database table. You will likely need to run the ETL process multiple times, but the data should only be imported once; hence the initial cleanup task. Drag the SQL Task from the toolbox. Double click to open the details. Specify the connection settings: Use ADO.NET connection type. Add a new connection using the dropdown. This will open a new dialog, where you need to click on the New button again to add a new connection. Use the same connection settings (address and authentication) as before. When you configured the connection properties, make sure to press the Test button to verify the settings. Specify a truncate table <tablename> sql statement to prune the table contents. The sql command should NOT contain the database name; that is already configured in the connection manager. Add a new Data flow element to the control flow pane. Give a meaningful name to this task: \"import users\". This task should follow the previous cleanup task: draw a line from the previous task box to this one to specify the ordering. Your control flow should like like the following at this moment. Open the data flow element by double clicking it. Drag a Flat file source from the toolbox to the data flow pane. Double click to open in. Add a new Flat file connection manager that specifies the source file and its details. Browse the input file BX-Users.csv from your local disk. Set the correct Format for parsing Format: Delimited Text qualifier: specify \" (double quotation mark) Check \"Column names in the first data row\" Switch to the Columns page (within the dialog) Verify that the Row delimiter is {CR}{LF} and the Column delimiter is semicolon. Switch to the Advanced page (within the dialog) Verify that the correct number of columns is present Change the UserID to be parsed as four byte signed integer Although the age should be a number, it must be parsed as a string here, because there are values in the CSV with the literal NULL text Increase the length ( OutputColumnWidth ) of the Location column from 50 to 1.000 The preview pane is a good way to verify the results. Make sure that there are no lingering quotation marks in the values (if there are, you missed to specify the text qualifier before). Close the dialog. If you need to modify the settings, you will find this Connection manager at the bottom of the designer surface. In order to split the Location column into two, and to parse the Age as a number, add a Derived column transformation (drag one from the SSIS Toolbox pane to the data flow editor surface). Connect the blue output of the file source to into this new box to specify the data flow direction (see image below for reference). Then open the settings of the Derived column element to specify how the derived values are calculated. Add a new column that contains the age as an integer. Check if the string is \"NULL\", in that case keep the null value, or cast to int. Use the following expression: [Age] == \"NULL\" ? NULL(DT_I4) : (DT_I4)[Age] . (You may need to change the column names.) Split the location column into two, and include your Neptun code in the text: create a new City and a new Country column using string operations; Country should be prefixed with your neptun code. Take a look at a few examples of the Location : they are in the form of \"city, state, country\" To separate the country find the second comma in the text. The rest is the city (you can keep the state included in the city text). Prefix the country with your Neptun code by concatenating it as a string to the front. E.g. \"nyc, new york, usa\" becomes: Country: \"NEPTUN usa\" City: \"nyc, new york\" Find more information on the syntax of the Expression here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/expressions/integration-services-ssis-expressions?view=sql-server-2017) Remove duplicate records. Add a new Sort transformation, then connect it to the output of the previous element. Open its settings: chose to sort on the UserID , and check the Remove rows with duplicate sort values checkbox. Add an ADO NET Destination component (look in the Other Destinations category) to save the data into database. Direct the output of the previous Sort component here. Open the component settings dialog by double clicking the component box. Use the connection manager created before. (Make sure not to create a new connection manager - the database access has already been defined in the existing connection manager.) Select the users table you created as target. Check the mapping and make sure that the right fields go into the right columns. Make sure to double check the Age column because it may exist as a number and as a string too; you need the numbered type here. (Mind, that the input column names may be different for you.) If you were to execute the process now, it would fail due to errors in the Derived columns transformation. Some content does not correspond to the transformations. Let us skip these rows. Add another ADO NET Destination component. Point the red arrow from the Derived column into this new database destination.

Close this dialog. Open the new ADO NET Destination and specify its settings too. Although the result of the transformations are not available, we still save the UserId value.

Run the ETL process by using the Start button on the toolbar of Visual Studio. Verify that the execution succeeded. If not, see this guide for debugging and resolving typical issues. If the process succeeded, verify the contents of the table using SQL Server Management Studio. Verify that you added your Neptun code prefix to the Country names. There will be a few rows with NULL values, these are the records that failed the Derived column transformation.

You can find this solution in the root of the checked out git repository. Open the solution with Visual Studio, then open Package.dtsx from Solution explorer . Find the SSIS Toolbox ; you will need to use this window in the following tasks. If you cannot see this toolbox window, after opening Package.dtsx , look for the Extensions > SSIS > SSIS Toolbox menu. Add a new SQL Task to the Control flow that erases any content from the target database table. You will likely need to run the ETL process multiple times, but the data should only be imported once; hence the initial cleanup task. Drag the SQL Task from the toolbox. Double click to open the details. Specify the connection settings: Use ADO.NET connection type. Add a new connection using the dropdown. This will open a new dialog, where you need to click on the New button again to add a new connection. Use the same connection settings (address and authentication) as before. When you configured the connection properties, make sure to press the Test button to verify the settings. Specify a truncate table <tablename> sql statement to prune the table contents. The sql command should NOT contain the database name; that is already configured in the connection manager. Add a new Data flow element to the control flow pane. Give a meaningful name to this task: \"import users\". This task should follow the previous cleanup task: draw a line from the previous task box to this one to specify the ordering. Your control flow should like like the following at this moment. Open the data flow element by double clicking it. Drag a Flat file source from the toolbox to the data flow pane. Double click to open in. Add a new Flat file connection manager that specifies the source file and its details. Browse the input file BX-Users.csv from your local disk. Set the correct Format for parsing Format: Delimited Text qualifier: specify \" (double quotation mark) Check \"Column names in the first data row\" Switch to the Columns page (within the dialog) Verify that the Row delimiter is {CR}{LF} and the Column delimiter is semicolon. Switch to the Advanced page (within the dialog) Verify that the correct number of columns is present Change the UserID to be parsed as four byte signed integer Although the age should be a number, it must be parsed as a string here, because there are values in the CSV with the literal NULL text Increase the length ( OutputColumnWidth ) of the Location column from 50 to 1.000 The preview pane is a good way to verify the results. Make sure that there are no lingering quotation marks in the values (if there are, you missed to specify the text qualifier before). Close the dialog. If you need to modify the settings, you will find this Connection manager at the bottom of the designer surface. In order to split the Location column into two, and to parse the Age as a number, add a Derived column transformation (drag one from the SSIS Toolbox pane to the data flow editor surface). Connect the blue output of the file source to into this new box to specify the data flow direction (see image below for reference). Then open the settings of the Derived column element to specify how the derived values are calculated. Add a new column that contains the age as an integer. Check if the string is \"NULL\", in that case keep the null value, or cast to int. Use the following expression: [Age] == \"NULL\" ? NULL(DT_I4) : (DT_I4)[Age] . (You may need to change the column names.) Split the location column into two, and include your Neptun code in the text: create a new City and a new Country column using string operations; Country should be prefixed with your neptun code. Take a look at a few examples of the Location : they are in the form of \"city, state, country\" To separate the country find the second comma in the text. The rest is the city (you can keep the state included in the city text). Prefix the country with your Neptun code by concatenating it as a string to the front. E.g. \"nyc, new york, usa\" becomes: Country: \"NEPTUN usa\" City: \"nyc, new york\" Find more information on the syntax of the Expression here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/expressions/integration-services-ssis-expressions?view=sql-server-2017) Remove duplicate records. Add a new Sort transformation, then connect it to the output of the previous element. Open its settings: chose to sort on the UserID , and check the Remove rows with duplicate sort values checkbox. Add an ADO NET Destination component (look in the Other Destinations category) to save the data into database. Direct the output of the previous Sort component here. Open the component settings dialog by double clicking the component box. Use the connection manager created before. (Make sure not to create a new connection manager - the database access has already been defined in the existing connection manager.) Select the users table you created as target. Check the mapping and make sure that the right fields go into the right columns. Make sure to double check the Age column because it may exist as a number and as a string too; you need the numbered type here. (Mind, that the input column names may be different for you.) If you were to execute the process now, it would fail due to errors in the Derived columns transformation. Some content does not correspond to the transformations. Let us skip these rows. Add another ADO NET Destination component. Point the red arrow from the Derived column into this new database destination. A the Configure Error Output dialog will pop up to specify how to handle errors. For all columns and error types select Redirect row . There is a total number of 6 elements to change here.
